      Paragraphs are <s>necessary</s> for conveying any point you are trying to make.
      It's imperative that you write a few sentences at the very least in order to engage and captivate an audience.
      That said, it's also very important to keep an eye on the length of the paragraphs so that they don't get too long.
      A very long paragraph can bore a reader and make them lose interest in the subject.
